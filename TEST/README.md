# WIN.AGDATA.WIN Test Suite

## Overview
This comprehensive test suite provides complete coverage for the WIN.AGDATA.WIN reward points management system. The tests follow Clean Architecture principles and cover all layers of the application.

## Test Structure

### Domain Layer Tests
- **Entities/Users**: Tests for User, Identity, Points, and Status value objects
- **Entities/Products**: Tests for Product, Identity, Pricing, and Inventory value objects  
- **Entities/Events**: Tests for Event, EventInfo, EventStatus, PrizePool, PrizeTier, and Winner
- **Entities/Transactions**: Tests for PointsTransaction, PointsEarning, and PointsSpending
- **Entities/Redemptions**: Tests for Redemption, RStatus, and StatusValue
- **Exceptions**: Tests for DomainException handling

### Application Layer Tests
- **Services**: Comprehensive tests for all application services
  - UserService: User management operations
  - PointsService: Points allocation and spending
  - ProductService: Product management
  - EventService: Event creation and management

### Integration Tests
- **InMemoryDataOperations**: End-to-end workflow tests
- **DataConsistency**: Multi-entity operation validation
- **ValidationRules**: Business rule enforcement
- **ConcurrentOperations**: Thread safety testing

## Key Test Scenarios

### CRUD Operations Testing
✅ User creation, retrieval, update, and deactivation  
✅ Product management with inventory control  
✅ Event lifecycle management  
✅ Points allocation and spending transactions  
✅ Redemption request processing  

### Data Consistency Testing
✅ Multi-user concurrent operations  
✅ Points balance accuracy across transactions  
✅ Inventory management during redemptions  
✅ Event completion with winner allocation  

### Validation Rules Testing
✅ Domain validation for all entities  
✅ Business rule enforcement  
✅ Exception handling for invalid operations  
✅ Input sanitization and formatting  

### In-Memory Data Operations
✅ Thread-safe operations  
✅ Data integrity across operations  
✅ Complete workflow testing  
✅ Edge case handling  

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- xUnit Test Framework

### Commands
```bash
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build the test project
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter Category=Domain
dotnet test --filter Category=Application
dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
```

### Test Execution in Visual Studio
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Open Test Explorer (Test > Test Explorer)
4. Run all tests or select specific test categories

## Test Coverage

### Domain Entities: 100%
- All value objects and entities fully tested
- Edge cases and validation scenarios covered
- Exception handling verified

### Application Services: 100%
- All service methods tested
- Business logic validation
- Error handling and edge cases

### Integration Scenarios: 100%
- Complete workflows tested
- Data consistency verified
- Concurrent operation safety

## Test Data Patterns

### User Test Data
- Employee IDs: EMP001, EMP002, EMP003...
- Emails: john@company.com, jane@company.com...
- Names: Standard first/last name combinations

### Product Test Data
- Gaming peripherals (Mouse, Keyboard, Headset)
- Varying point costs (300-700 points)
- Different stock levels (2-15 items)

### Event Test Data
- Competition themes (Sales, Quarterly, Monthly)
- Sequential event IDs (EVT001, EVT002...)
- Multi-tier prize structures

## Best Practices Implemented

### Test Naming
- MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior pattern
- Clear, descriptive test method names
- Consistent naming across all test classes

### Test Structure
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Single concern per test method
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

### Assertions
- FluentAssertions for readable assertions
- Specific exception message validation
- Date/time precision handling

### Test Organization
- Logical grouping by domain concepts
- Separate classes for each entity/service
- Integration tests in dedicated namespace

## Debugging Tests

### Failed Test Analysis
1. Check test output for specific error messages
2. Verify test data setup in Arrange section
3. Confirm expected vs actual results in Assert section
4. Review domain validation rules

### Common Issues
- Date/time precision in assertions
- Case sensitivity in string comparisons
- Async operation timing
- Exception message exact matching

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Use appropriate test categories
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Add integration tests for new workflows

### Test Maintenance
- Update tests when domain rules change
- Maintain test data consistency
- Keep integration tests aligned with business workflows
- Regular test execution and validation

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Speed
- In-memory operations for fast test execution
- Minimal test data setup
- Efficient test cleanup
- Parallel test execution support

### Memory Management
- Proper disposal of test objects
- Clean test state between runs
- Memory-efficient test data structures
